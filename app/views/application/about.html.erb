      Jailbird is the last phone number you'll ever need.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only takes 3 easy steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sign up</li>
      <li>Import your contacts and customize your groups</li>
      <li>Set up your personal Jailbird pin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you're set up, call Jailbird from any phone and access your personalized address book.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one remembers phone numbers anymore. Jailbird can help forward your calls to anyone in your phone book, send a voice blast to any of your groups, or send a transcribed text message from a voice recording.
